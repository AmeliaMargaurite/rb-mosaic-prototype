# Prototype for Style Library Proposal

This is a small demonstration of using Web Component elements with Shadow DOM enabled, while using shared CSS styling that is usable on native HTML elements and Web Components alike.

In a real world situation there would be much more complex components, and I would use at least Typescript and a bundler like Webpack for a full build.
